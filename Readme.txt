 ATX backplate is based on one of first backplates for ATX motherboards.
 Expansion Slot is taken from "Pentagon 1024 SL v2.666 LE". Its location and pin placement doesn't allow to freely use Pentevo cards. Some of them can be used, but they must be placed upside down, with IC's on top.

Why "Express PCB"? You may ask. I found it easy for me to add my own components to design and was easy to learn. It has limitations of its own but I found it more challenging when designing something ;)
